    <h1>The Nintendo 64!</h1>
    <h2>What is the Nintendo 64?</h2>

    <p id="n64Intro">
        The Nintendo 64, also known as the N64, was a video game console released in 1964, hence the name N64. <br>
        In 1965, due to death of the mascot of the console, Mario Mario, the console was permenantly discontinued. <br>
        However, for it's short availability, it offered some incredibly interesting games.

    <h2>Super Luigi 16</h2>

            The first game released on the system was Super Luigi 16, the 16th installment in the hit franchise. 
            The game was a huge success, selling over 17 copies worldwide. The game was one of the first 3D platformers
            to be released, and even through poor camera controls, was critically adored.
        </p>

        <p>
            There were initially plans to create a sequel to Super Luigi 16, 
            with the development title being Super Luigi 20, taking after both Apple and Microsoft in skipping numbers in franchises.
            The director of the game, Shiguru Miyamoto, spoke out in disappointment when the game was cancelled,
            saying that it would have been the greatest in the series up to that point.

        <p>
            However, the cancellation of the console saw the game, and the series as a whole, being put on hold indefinitely.
            Supposedly leaked versions of this Super Luigi 20's rom have been uploaded to various sites throughout
            the years, but their authenticity is currently unknown.
